### Sample Size Calculator

In this tab, the goal is to find appropriate sample sizes for the problem at hand.

+ The x-axis of the plot will be **n**, the sample sizes in the range you have selected.
+ The y-axis of the plot is the probability of rejecting the requirement. If the **true probability** is some value that falls outside of the requirements, this probability is equal to the **statistical power of the test**. Conversely, if the true probability is some value that falls within the requirements, this probability is a calculation of Type I error with the given conditional parameters.

### Effect Size Calculator

In this tab, the goal is to find how probability of rejection changes for given sample sizes when the effect size changes.
It is common to use this calculator after you have decided on candidate sample sizes, possibly from using the aforementioned the sample size calculator.

+ The x-axis of the plot will be **effect sizes**, the effect sizes in the range you have selected
+ The y-axis is the probability of rejection, similar to how it is defined above. Keep in mind that effect sizes represent deviations from the specified requirement.
