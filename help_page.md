### Sample Size Calculator
Prince waz here!!!

In this tab, the goal is to find appropriate sample sizes for the problem at hand.

+ The x-axis of the plot will be the sample sizes in the range you have selected.
+ The y-axis of the plot is the probability of failing (or passing if you check the "Flip Y-Axis"" box) the acceptance criteria. 
+ The "Acceptance Criteria Risk Level" field specifies the acceptance criteria that will be used. Low risk corresponds to the confidence interval including or surpassing the requirement. Medium risk corresponds to the point estimate surpassing the requirment. High risk corresponds to the full confidence interval surpassing the requirement. High Delta risk corresponds to the point estimate surpassing the requirement and the full confidence interval surpassing the requirement plus/minus some value delta.


### Effect Size Calculator

In this tab, the goal is to find how probability of passing/failing the acceptance criteria changes for given sample sizes when the effect size changes.
It is common to use this calculator after you have decided on candidate sample sizes, possibly from using the aforementioned the sample size calculator.

+ The x-axis of the plot will be the **effect sizes** in the range you have selected
+ The y-axis is the probability of failing (or passing if you check the "Flip Y-Axis"" box) the acceptance criteria, similar to how it is defined above. Keep in mind that effect sizes represent deviations from the specified requirement.
+ The "Acceptance Criteria Risk Level" specifies the acceptance criteria and follows the same rules as the field from the sample size calculator tab (details above).
